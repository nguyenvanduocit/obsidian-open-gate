# Quick switch

You don’t want every gate to show up in the left sidebar.

You will turn off the "Ribbon" options of the gates. Then how to access them quickly? We have two ways to do that.

## Command Palette

1. Open the command palette (`Ctrl+P` on Windows/Linux, `Cmd+P` on macOS).
2. Type `Open gate` and you will see the list of gates.
3. Select the gate you want to open.
4. Press `Enter`.

## Hotkey

By default, the hotkey to open the last gate is `Ctrl+Shift+G` on Windows/Linux, `Cmd+Shift+G` on macOS (You can change it in the settings.), a popup will show up with the list of gates. Click on the gate you want to open.
